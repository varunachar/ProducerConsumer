{"body":"ProducerConsumer\r\n================\r\n\r\nSimple producer consumer implementation with an example.\r\n\r\n\r\n**RejectionStrategy**\r\nThe strategy to use when a Task has been rejected by the Queue. An example FileRejectionStrategy can be found in the test folder.\r\n\r\n**ResumeStrategy**\r\nThe strategy to use to resume tasks previously rejected by the Queue. An exmaple FileResumeStrategy can be found in the test folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n**How to use:**<br>\r\nSupply a **queue.properties** file in the classpath. The properties needed are :\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>corePoolSize</li>\r\n\t<li>maxPoolSize</li>\r\n\t<li>keepAliveTime</li>\r\n\t<li>capacity</li>\r\n\t<li>resumeThreshold</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nDocumentation of the properties needed can be read in the Settings.java class.\r\n \r\nQueue can be created using 2 constructors.<br>\r\n<code>Queue queue = new Queue(new RejectionStrategy());</code><br>\r\nor<br>\r\n<code>Queue queue = new Queue(new RejectionStrategy(), new ResumeStrategy());</code><br>\r\n\r\nIf a ResumeStrategy has been specified, the queue needs to the told to start looking for failed tasks. That can be done like so:<br>\r\n<code>queue.start();</code><br>\r\n\r\nThe example in the test folder shows how the queue can been used. It produces emails with file attachments. The task simply prints the email contents (doesn't actually send it). It utilizes full rejection and resumption capabilities of the queue.<br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a maven project built for Java 5 and above. Non maven users will need to download **Apache's CommonsIO** and **Jackson library** and add to classpath for running the test. No other dependencies needed for the project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
